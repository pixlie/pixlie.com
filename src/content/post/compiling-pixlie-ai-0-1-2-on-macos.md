The latest updates in our dependencies causes the compilation of [Pixlie AI](https://github.com/pixlie/PixlieAI) on MacOS to break,
since it is not able to get access to some of the system dependencies.

To fix these issues, you need to take the following steps:
1. Install `llvm` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), by running:
  
    ```shell
    brew install llvm
    ```
2. Add the following lines at the bottom of the file `~/.zshrc`:

    ```shell
    export LIBCLANG_PATH=$(brew --prefix llvm)/lib
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBCLANG_PATH:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    export PATH=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin:$PATH

    export CC=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang
    export CXX=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang++
    export ROCKSDB_INCLUDE_DIR=$(brew --prefix rocksdb)/include
    export ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR=$(brew --prefix rocksdb)/lib
    ```

If you still face any issues with compiling Pixlie AI, please do not hesitate to [contact us](https://pixlie.com/contact). We would love to hear from you â€“ issue or no issue.
