The latest updates in our dependencies causes the compilation of [Pixlie AI](https://github.com/pixlie/PixlieAI) on MacOS to break,
since it is not able to get access to some of the system dependencies.

To fix these issues, you need to take the following steps:
1. Install `llvm` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), by running:
    ```shell
    brew install llvm
    ```
2. Add the following lines at the bottom of the file `~/.zshrc`:
    ```shell
    export LIBCLANG_PATH=$(brew --prefix llvm)/lib
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBCLANG_PATH:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    export PATH=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin:$PATH

    export CC=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang
    export CXX=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang++
    ```
    To quickly open the file using TextEdit from your terminal, you can run:
    ```shell
    open -a "TextEdit" ~/.zshrc
    ```
3. Open a new terminal or reload the environment:
    ```shell
    omz reload
    ```
4. Now try to run Pixlie AI while you're in the `pixlie_ai` folder:
    ```shell
    cargo run --bin cli
    ```

_Update: 2 Mar, 2025_

Some people have reported that the above steps are not enough and it still throws the error ``linking with `cc` failed``.

If you're facing this error after making the above changes, please make sure you are using a fresh/reloaded terminal environment and take the following steps:

1. Install `rocksdb`:
    ```shell
    brew install rocksdb
    ```
2. Add the following lines at the bottom of the file `~/.zshrc`:
    ```shell
    export ROCKSDB_INCLUDE_DIR=$(brew --prefix rocksdb)/include
    export ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR=$(brew --prefix rocksdb)/lib
    ```
3. Open a new terminal or reload the environment and try running Pixlie AI again.

Pixlie is open source. And while we are still in the early phases, we will be finalizing this piece of the puzzle in the coming weeks. [Try it out for your self](https://github.com/pixlie/PixlieAI) and see what PixlieAI can do.
