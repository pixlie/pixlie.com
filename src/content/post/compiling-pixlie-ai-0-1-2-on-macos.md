  description: Fix compilation errors on MacOS after recent dependency updates.

The latest updates in our dependencies causes the compilation of [Pixlie AI](https://github.com/pixlie/PixlieAI) on MacOS to break,
since it is not able to get access to some of the system dependencies.

To fix these issues, you need to take the following steps:
1. Install `llvm` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), by running:
    ```shell
    brew install llvm
    ```
2. Add the following lines at the bottom of the file `~/.zshrc`:
    ```shell
    export LIBCLANG_PATH=$(brew --prefix llvm)/lib
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBCLANG_PATH:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    export PATH=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin:$PATH

    export CC=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang
    export CXX=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang++
    ```
    To quickly open the file using TextEdit from your terminal, you can run:
    ```shell
    open -a "TextEdit" ~/.zshrc
    ```
3. Open a new terminal or reload the environment:
    ```shell
    omz reload
    ```
4. Now try to run Pixlie AI while you're in the `pixlie_ai` folder:
    ```shell
    cargo run --bin cli
    ```

Some users have reported that the above steps are not enough and it still throws the error ``linking with `cc` failed``.

If you're facing this error after making the above changes, please make sure you are using a fresh/reloaded terminal environment and take the following steps:

1. Install `rocksdb`:
    ```shell
    brew install rocksdb
    ```
2. Add the following lines at the bottom of the file `~/.zshrc`:
    ```shell
    export ROCKSDB_INCLUDE_DIR=$(brew --prefix rocksdb)/include
    export ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR=$(brew --prefix rocksdb)/lib
    ```
3. Open a new terminal or reload the environment and try running Pixlie AI again.

The above steps still throw an error in `rust-analyzer` running in the VS Code IDE, affecting some development features.

To resolve these issues, you can do the following:

1. Install `lld`:
    ```shell
    brew install lld
    ```
2. Run the following to check the installation path of Homebrew:
    ```shell
    brew --prefix
    ```
    If the base path is not the same in step (3) below, you can use the correct path in `settings.json`.
3. Add these settings to `.vscode/settings.json` in the project root:
    ```json
    {
        "rust-analyzer.runnables.extraEnv": {
            "LIBCLANG_PATH": "/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib",
            "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH": "/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib",
            "PATH": "/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:${env:PATH}",

            "CC": "/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang",
            "CXX": "/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++",
            
            "ROCKSDB_INCLUDE_DIR": "/opt/homebrew/opt/rocksdb/include",
            "ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR": "/opt/homebrew/opt/rocksdb/lib",
            
            "LD": "/opt/homebrew/opt/lld/bin/ld64.lld",
            "LDFLAGS": "-fuse-ld=/opt/homebrew/opt/lld/bin/ld64.lld",
            "AR": "/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar"
        }
    }
    ```
    You can exclude `ROCKSDB_INCLUDE_DIR` & `ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR`, if you have not installed `rocksdb`.
