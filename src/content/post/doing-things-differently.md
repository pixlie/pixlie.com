We have decided to do things a bit differently at Pixlie. 

## Privacy First

Privacy is at the forefront of all we do. We aren't monetizing your data. In fact, we don't even host your data - you do. Your data stays completely under your control through self-hosting, giving you true data ownership and privacy.

## Open Source

We believe in the power of open source. By making PixlieAI's core an open-source product, we ensure it will always belong to the community - not just us. This means developers can contribute and help us build something amazing together, companies can customize it to their specific needs, and everyone can verify exactly how their data is being handled. We're not just building a product; we're fostering a community where innovation and transparency go hand in hand. While we offer premium features to sustain our business, our commitment to an open core means the fundamental capabilities will always be accessible to everyone.

## Community

We are not fans of marketing in the sense of shoving our product down your throats or paying money to see us everywhere. We are looking to build something useful, that people love. We want community and organic growth to be the reason we grow.

## Making a Difference

We believe in giving back and making the world better. That is why, before we have even earned our first dollar, we are working with non-profits through [Tech to the Rescue](https://www.techtotherescue.org/) to implement PixlieAI, completely for free, to help them with their mission in making the world a better place. Our first implementations of PixlieAI will actively help make the world a better place.

## Bootstrapping

We believe in staying small to be great. We aren’t chasing after funding from VCs that will then breath down our necks to grow at all costs. Instead, we work smart and will stay bootstrapped. This ensures we will always be around, we won’t be sold, we will stay efficient and our priorities will be making an amazing product with an amazing user experience that is a sustainable business - not grow no matter what. 


When you purchase our paid features, you will not be paying for ads. You won’t be another number for us. We will not be growing at all costs. Instead, we will be improving our product to improve your workflow and make smarter search available to everyone.
