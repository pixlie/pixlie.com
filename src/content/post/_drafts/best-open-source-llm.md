AI is everywhere, and it can't be avoided. We are seeing it in film making, in marketing, and in development, to just name a few. With apps like ChatGPT and Claude, any questions we have can be answered quickly through Large Language Models (LLMs), and they can answer almost anything. 

However, the concerns of privacy have always been at the forefront of these LLMs (large language models) like ChatGPT and Claude. 

This is where the importance of open source LLMs come in.  Models that we can self-host and train with our own data is going to be protected and not shared is become more and more important. 

## What does Open Source LLMs mean? 
There are a few important things that make an LLM open source.

First, they must have an [open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses). This means you can use view, use, modify and redistribute the LLM, completely for free.  

Secondly, there should be public to model weights must be available. This means you can download the whole model and not just access it via API. 

Lastly, the model should be transparent in how it was trained and what data was used. 

With any open source LLM, you will need to host the model (which can be expensive in itself), and support is not provided. That being said, it is becoming easier and easier to host your own models with applications like [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

## Why does open source matter? 
Why does privacy matter? If privacy doesn't matter to you, and you don't want to build your own model, then open source LLMs probably don't matter to you. But if you want to keep your data or what you ask these LLMs private, then open source LLMs are the only way to do it. 

It democratizes LLMs as well. Anybody can use it, and contribute to it.  Instead of AI being in the hands of one or two companies, its available to everyone

## Top Open Source LLMs
There are many, many open source LLMs. But in this article, we are going to go over only the top ones, as not all are created equally. For a full list, check out [Eugeneyan's Open LLMs list](https://github.com/eugeneyan/open-llms).

### DeepSeek

Deep Seek is the most recent open-source LLM, which took the world by storm when its app started ranking number one on the app store, out performing Chat GPT.  Built with less resources but is on the top of its reasoning, 

### Llama (Meta AI)

### Mixtral (Mistral AI)


Pixlie is open source. And while we are still in the early phases, we will be finalizing this piece of the puzzle in the coming weeks. [Try it out for your self](https://github.com/pixlie/PixlieAI) and see what PixlieAI can do.
